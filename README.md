# Hi there, I'm Youngwook Kim ðŸ‘‹

I'm the CEO of @algorima, an AI enthusiast, and a devotee of Emacs. I'm passionate about the intersection of AI, education, and their potential to shape society. I'm currently leading two exciting projects:

## ðŸš€ [Iris: A Multilingual Voice Assistant](https://ywkim.github.io/building-multilingual-voice-assistant-iris-openai-picovoice/)

Iris is a multilingual voice assistant that combines OpenAI's GPT models and Picovoice's Porcupine for keyword detection. It's a unique blend of advanced AI capabilities and user-friendly interaction. If you're interested in voice assistant technology, I invite you to join the journey of Iris.

## ðŸ”§ [GPT-Commit](https://github.com/ywkim/gpt-commit)

GPT-Commit is an Emacs package that automatically generates conventional commit messages using the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from OpenAI. It's a handy tool for developers who want to maintain a clean and organized commit history.

In my spare time, I'm leading a ChatGPT study group and preparing to open-source a new HR SaaS. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and I'm excited to see what we can achieve together.

Remember, 'Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish'.
