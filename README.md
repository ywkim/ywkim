# Hello, I'm Youngwook Kim ðŸ‘‹

I'm the CEO of @algorima, an AI enthusiast, and a devotee of Emacs. I'm passionate about the intersection of AI, education, and their potential to shape society. I'm currently leading several exciting projects:

## ðŸŒŸ [AlolA: Enhancing Emotional Connections Through AI](https://buppy-chat.streamlit.app/)

AlolA continues to bridge the emotional gap created by modern technology, fostering deeper human connections. Our premier AI, Buppy, not only enhances emotional communication but also supports multi-language interactions and voice responses, enriching life's pivotal moments and elevating relationship quality. Key features now include dynamic conversation context analysis, proactive messaging based on user-defined schedules, and intricate sentiment analysis to react with contextually appropriate emojis. Through integration with ElevenLabs API and LangChain, Buppy offers enriched, personalized interactions that adapt to individual preferences and contexts, ensuring a seamless and empathetic user experience.

## ðŸ”§ [GPT-Commit](https://github.com/ywkim/gpt-commit)

GPT-Commit is an Emacs package that automatically generates conventional commit messages using the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from OpenAI. It's a handy tool for developers who want to maintain a clean and organized commit history.

In addition to these projects, I lead a ChatGPT study group, exploring the potential of collaborative AI to bring transformative changes to our communities.

Stay connected, and remember, 'Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish'.
